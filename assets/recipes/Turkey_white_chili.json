,"text": "Cook beans if using dry beans: Combine soaked and drained beans, turkey stock, and half the onions in a large soup pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until beans are very soft, 1 to 3 hours or more, depending on the type of white beans you are using. Cannelli beans are tender and tend to cook rather quickly. Navy beans take longer. Add additional water (or watered-down stock), if necessary. Or you can skip the soaking and cook the beans in turkey stock with the onions in a pressure cooker. Cook on high pressure for 30 minutes, then let release naturally for 10 minutes. If using canned beans: Combine the beans and the turkey stock in a large soup pot and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer."

This changes it up enough without taking away from the awesomeness of the turkey. I used 2 cans of cannellini beans, and loved the creaminess. I'm pretty sure I'll be making some more at the end of December.<\/p>"
